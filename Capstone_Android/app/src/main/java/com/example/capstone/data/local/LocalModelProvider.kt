/**
 * Owns the single, application-scoped LiteRT-LM [Engine].
 *
 * The engine costs ~10s to initialize and holds a large native allocation, so
 * there is exactly one for the whole process, created lazily on first use.
 * Conversation objects are cheap and are created fresh per inference by callers.
 *
 * The model file is NOT bundled in the APK (too large). It is adb-pushed to
 * [MODEL_DIR]; see [modelPath].
 *
 * ## Locking
 *
 * Two mutexes, always acquired in the order **[inferenceMutex] then
 * [initMutex]**. Every path that needs both takes them in that order, so there
 * is no lock-order inversion and no deadlock:
 *
 * - [initialize] takes [initMutex] alone, so only one engine is ever built.
 * - [withInference] takes [inferenceMutex] for the whole decode, and calls
 *   [initialize] inside it. Holding [inferenceMutex] across the decode is what
 *   stops [useSpec] from closing the engine out from under a running
 *   conversation.
 * - [useSpec] and [release] take [inferenceMutex] first - which waits for any
 *   in-flight decode to finish - and only then [initMutex] to close and rebuild.
 *
 * ## One engine at a time
 *
 * [useSpec] closes the current engine and waits for that close to return before
 * constructing the replacement. Two loaded models will not fit in this device's
 * RAM, so the two never overlap, not even briefly.
